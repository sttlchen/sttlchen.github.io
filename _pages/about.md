Hello!/Guten Tag!/你好！
======
I graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in December 2024 with a degree in Mathematics and Statistics, and currently attending the Master of Statistical Science program at Duke. I am actively searching for TA/RA opportunities, and you can contact me through <a href="mailto:tc434@duke.edu">email</a>.
My departmental website can be accessed <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Steven.Chen">here</a>.
